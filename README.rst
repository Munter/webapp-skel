About
=====

This is a webapp skeleton directory that can be used as a template to start new webapp projects with `assetgraph-builder <https://github.com/One-com/assetgraph-builder>`_ and `Ext JS <https://github.com/One-com/Ext-JS-4>`_

Installation
============

run `bootstrap.sh <bootstrap.sh>`_ to install all dependencies.
This will do a git checkout of nodejs in your home directory and built it, install npm, install required debian packages and install `assetgraph-builder <https://github.com/One-com/assetgraph-builder>`_.

Keep your installation up to date with 'npm update' after you've updated `package.json <package.json>`_ with your desired assetgraph-builder version.

Ext JS is included as a submodule and set up to work with your web apps

Directory Structure
===================

http-pub
--------
This is where your development version of the webapp resides.
Put all your public assets in here and include them the way you normally do, or with one.include('filename') to use the assetgraph dependency system.
"make development" will update the dependencies

http-pub/index.html.template
----------------------------
All html files in your development version should have '.template' appended to them.
The build system will produce a development version with the proper dependencies resolved and place them in your file name without '.template'.
Remember to add html files you want built into the PAGES variable in `Makefile <Makefile>`_

http-pub/3rdparty/
------------------
This is where external dependencies, like javascript or css frameworks, or your own library will be placed.
Per default Ext JS is checked in so you have a reference.
When you set up any new external library and you want to include things from it using labels in assetgraph, remember to define a label in LABELS in `Makefile <Makefile>`_

http-pub-production
-------------------
This is where the minified production build of your web application will be placed.
Static files will be concatenated, minified, renamed to an md5-hash of their content and placed in http-pub-production/static

http-pub-cdn
------------
Exactly like http-pub-production, except that static files are now assumed to be on CDN_ROOT as defined in `Makefile <Makefile>`_.
Remember to copy your static files there if you are using a CDN.


Assetgraph
==========
The build system used in this setup is `Assetgraph-builder <https://github.com/One-com/assetgraph-builder>`_.
It uses `Assetgraph <https://github.com/One-com/assetgraph>`_ and `Assetgraph-sprite <https://github.com/One-com/assetgraph-sprite>`_.
Please read the documentation of those two projects to make the best use of all the automated build features available in Assetgraph-builder.
